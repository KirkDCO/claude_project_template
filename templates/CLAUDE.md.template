# Claude Code Project Context

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Development Guidelines
**CRITICAL**: Before making ANY code changes, read and follow `CODING_GUIDELINES.md`

### 🤖 AI Assistant Session Startup:
**Use session startup protocol** - Create a SESSION_STARTUP.md file or alias for consistent guidelines enforcement

**Recommended alias for ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:**
```bash
alias cstart='claude "Review SESSION_STARTUP.md and follow the instructions."'
```

### 👤 Human Developer Resources:
- **`DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md`** - Personal workflow and collaboration patterns
- **`CODING_GUIDELINES.md`** - Universal architecture principles
- **`SESSION_STARTUP.md`** - Session startup protocol template (recommended)
- **`./scripts/dry_audit.sh`** - Automated compliance checking (if applicable)

### 🔍 Helpful Reminders:
If the human seems to be:
- Making requests without mentioning guidelines → Gently remind about CODING_GUIDELINES.md
- Rushing through features → Suggest reviewing DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md session startup ritual
- Accepting quick/messy solutions → Reference the "Quality Control Habits" section
- Asking for duplicated functionality → Run grep search and suggest utils/ consolidation
- Working across multiple sessions → Ask if they need a quick architecture review

### 🏗️ Architecture Notes
- **utils/ is the single source of truth** for all reusable functionality
- **All modules import from utils/** rather than implementing their own
- **No duplicate implementations** - follow DRY principles religiously
- **Performance optimized** - Use sampling patterns for large datasets
